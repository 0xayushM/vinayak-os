schema/queries.py
──────────────────
Pre-aggregated business query functions — one per dashboard panel.

Rules:
  • Every function returns a typed dict, NEVER raw rows.
  • Top-N caps are defined as constants here and enforced in every query.
  • Phase 2 AI reads ONLY from these functions — never from raw SQL.
  • Adding a new function requires both builders to agree on the schema.

Multi-tenant scoping:
  Every public query takes `company_id` (the brand / workspace key) as its
  first argument after `conn` and filters `WHERE company_id = %s`. Two brands
  syncing into the same tables therefore never see each other's rows. The
  company_id filter is always the FIRST predicate so the (company_id, …)
  composite indexes added in migration 001 are used.

Anti-context-rot guarantee:
  An AI model calling get_ar_summary() receives ~15 keys, not 5,000 rows.
  The pre-aggregation happens in SQL, not in Python, keeping it fast.

Usage:
    import psycopg2
    from vinayak.schema.queries import get_ar_summary
    conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
    data = get_ar_summary(conn, "protegere")
